# EV3 Maze Solver

This was an end-of-term solo project for a robotics course at SFU. The project is designed to work with developing solving algorithms and generative maze creation.

## 1. Description

This project is a C/RobotC-based program designed for the EV3 platform. It simulates a robot navigating through a maze using a right-sided wall-following algorithm. The program creates a virtual maze with defined rows and columns, where the robot must find its way from the starting point to a designated target cell.

## 2. Features

- Maze generation with customizable size.
- Simulation of robot movement within the maze.
- Detection of walls and navigational decision-making.
- Visual representation of the maze and robot on the EV3 screen.

## 3. Installation

To run this program, you need to have the ROBOTC environment set up for the EV3 platform. Follow these steps:

- Install ROBOTC for LEGO MINDSTORMS from the official website.
- - Connect your EV3 robot to your computer.
- Open the provided .c file in the ROBOTC environment.

## 4. Usage

After loading the program onto your EV3 robot, execute the program. The robot will start navigating the maze autonomously, trying to reach the predefined target cell. The EV3 screen displays the maze layout and the robot's current position.

## 5. Reflection

This was an interesting project. I enjoyed seeing an algorithm come to life to solve a maze. This was completed in 3 days I would have loved to continue to develop this into a larger project. However, after the class ended, we no longer had access to the software or hardware required for development.
